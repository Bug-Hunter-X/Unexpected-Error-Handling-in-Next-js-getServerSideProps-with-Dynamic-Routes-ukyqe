# Next.js: Handling Data Fetching Errors in getServerSideProps with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications involving data fetching in `getServerSideProps` with dynamic routes. The example shows how to properly handle potential errors during the data fetching process to prevent application crashes and improve user experience.

## The Problem

When using `getServerSideProps` with dynamic routes, it's crucial to handle cases where the data fetching might fail.  If the API request fails or returns an unexpected response, the application could crash without proper error handling. 

## The Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the response from the API request and returning an appropriate response from `getServerSideProps` when an error occurs. This prevents the component from rendering with incorrect or missing data, leading to a better user experience.

The solution includes error handling to catch potential errors and display fallback UI if necessary. It also demonstrates how to return a `notFound` response if the requested data is not found.  This avoids server-side errors and displays more informative messaging to the user.
